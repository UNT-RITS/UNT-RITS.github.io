# Using Rstudio on Talon3

RStudio is a development enivronment for R That is available on the Visualization nodes of Talon3. 

You can access an RStudio interface via a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) by going to one of the following addresses

```
http://vis.acs.unt.edu:8787
```

The login credentials are the same as your Talon3 login/password

Once you login, you have access to RStudio on the Talon3 network. You can execute simple R scripts, transer files, and visualizae data on Talon3.

Since RStudio is running on the Visualization login nodes, any computationally intensive processes are prohibited and can result in expulsion from using UNT HPC resouces. Any large R tasks and commands MUST be submitted as a SLURM batch job.
