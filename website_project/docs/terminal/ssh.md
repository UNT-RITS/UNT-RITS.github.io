# SSH Terminal Easy Configuration 

## Connecting from a Windows Computer

If you are using a Windows OS personal computer, you will need to download a SSH client application that supports SSH-2 protocol. 

Examples of these SSH client programs you can freely download are [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/), [Cygwin/X](https://x.cygwin.com/), and [SecureCRT](https://x.cygwin.com/)

You can also use other terminal approaches like using [Windows Subsytem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). This will allow you to run a Linux environment from inside your Windows OS. You can then, for example, the [Ubuntu app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) from the Microsoft Store.

Once you have installed a SSH client app, you can connect to Talon3 by entering in the Hostname of the [login Talon3 nodes](../overview/nodes.md#login-node): `talon3.hpc.unt.edu`

## Connecting from a Mac or Linux Computer

If you are logging from a Linux or Mac personal computer, make sure it has an SSH client (ssh, openssh, etc.) installed. Then access Talon3 by opening a Terminal application.

If you never used SSH before [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-to-connect-to-a-remote-server-in-ubuntu) is a helpful example.

Or if you don't know if you have SSH installed on your system, [click here for Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2017/04/28/howto-ssh-client-mac/) and [here for Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/install-openssh-server-in-linux/)
