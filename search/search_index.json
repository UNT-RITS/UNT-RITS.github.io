Please send an email to hpc-admin@unt.edu to schedule an appointment with a RITS staff member. Thank you for your understanding. Welcome to the High Performance Computing (HPC) documentation of the University of North Texas \u00b6 Recent Updates Tensorflow 2.1 is now available for both CPU and GPU. Use: module load tensorflow/2.1.0-gpu Dedicated module for the transformers library State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing for Pytorch and TensorFlow 2.0 . Currently tested mostly with PyTorch. Use: module load transformers About this documentaiton \u00b6 The purpose of this documentation is to be an add-on to the current official documentation available on our main website: https://hpc.unt.edu . What is UNT HPC? \u00b6 UNT HPC is a part of Research IT Services, offering state-of-the-art computing, storage, visualization, and networking service to the University of North Texas. We help researchers and other members of UNT use advance computing power to enable higher research throughput and expand research capabilities. Our services include the following: Maintaining HPC allocations and resources for UNT researchers and UNT courses Consultation services in performance research on HPC Community training and outreach including workshops and HPC tutorials Providing end-user HPC support Exploring grant opportunities for HPC related projects Acknowledging Talon \u00b6 Please acknowledge the support of the High-Performance Computing services in all publications with the following statement: \u201cComputational resources were provided by the University of North Texas High-Performance Computing Services, a division of the Research IT Services, University Information Technology, with additional support from UNT Office of Research and Economic Development.\u201d Alternatively, a short version will suffice: \u201cComputational resources were provided by UNT office of High-Performance Computing.\u201d Make sure you check out \u00b6 Usage Policy Operational Guidelines","title":"About"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-high-performance-computing-hpc-documentation-of-the-university-of-north-texas","text":"Recent Updates Tensorflow 2.1 is now available for both CPU and GPU.
